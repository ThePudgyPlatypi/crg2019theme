# Critical Response Group 2019 Theme

## Usage

Please use this guide to navigate your way thru the Critical Response Group Theme. I will roughly breakdown how to add general posts, new content, pages, team members and resource center content. 

### Posts
These are the different types of posts. Some are just in different categories, and others you need to select a different post type from the menu

#### Standard News Posts
**Post Type** - Posts
**Category** - Critical Response Group Post
Use this to add a post onto the blog page (News)

### Creating New Pages
To add a new page you can either talk to me or create a basic page in the form of the About Us page. You will need to pick a page template and image for the header. All content typed in Page editor will show before hardcoded anything.

### Shortcodes

**Add stylish button to your post**
The shortcode below can be pasted into a post and it will render a small button in either yellow or blue. 
Defaults
- Color: Yellow
- Text: Read More...

[small_button url="https://someurl.com" text="What you want the button to say" color="yellow||blue"]
